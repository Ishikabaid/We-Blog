      "body": "The definition of the word “beauty” is an aesthetically pleasing feature of an object or a person. The word “beauty” holds a distinctive positive meaning if applied to a person. It means that the character or the physical appearance of said individual is considered as beautiful in the speaker’s opinion. The definition of beauty is usually considered as subjective.\n\nIf we speak in general, when you see something and you are glad to see it, then we can say, that it is beautiful. There is no matter it it is the field with the flowers or the exotic bird, it is the beauty for us.\n\nBut the definition of the beauty is different for everyone, because everyone has his/her own point of view and all people are different, because of it they cannot like the same things. Also, it depends on the culture and on the level of the development of the person. For example, some men like blond women, but some of them just hate when the woman has blond hair.

It should not be like a shock, because it is just the personal statement and as all people are different, it is normal that they all think in the different way and have different point of view.\n\nThere are a lot of examples of the beauty which we can meet in our world. Even if we look through the history, we will see, that people liked to be the slaves of the beauty during many generations. But if there was one person, who showed the other point of view, the society did not accept him, but it was only the fact, that this person is individual and did not think like the other people.\n\nThe definition of the word “beauty” is an aesthetically pleasing feature of an object or a person.

      "body": "Nature is an important and integral part of mankind. It is one of the greatest blessings for human life; however, nowadays humans fail to recognize it as one. Nature has been an inspiration for numerous poets, writers, artists and more of yesteryears. This remarkable creation inspired them to write poems and stories in the glory of it. They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both living and non-living things. Therefore, people of the modern age should also learn something from people of yesteryear and start valuing nature before it gets too late.\n\n",
